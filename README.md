With Youtube blocking most if not all ad blockers i started to get annoyed with having to move my mouse and click the 'skip ad' button after the 5 seconds so i created this google extension. This google chrome extension that polls youtube to check if an ad is playing. if an ad is playing it will check to see if the ad is skippable using the 'skip ad' button. 

Please note the use of document.VisibilityState. This is used to reduce the amount of polling done, increasing efficiency.
